## Description
Tic Tac Toe Game made to practice OOP concepts like prototypical inheritance
and IIFE. I used [a recursive maximin algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) 
to create an unbeatable AI.

## Skills

- Javascript (OOP: IIFE Modules, Prototypical Inheritance, Factory Functions)
- CSS
- HTML
- GIT

## What I Learned

Keeping your code organized is super important! As your codebase grows more
complex readability becomes a necessity. I tried to make my project as
legible as possible but could use more practice with smaller commits and
smart object organization. Next project I want to draw out an object diagram
and map out how each of my objects should interact. I am still a bit confused
on how IIFE's can call other IIFE values that exist below them in the
main file.

We use getter and setters as object properties in js are naturally read only.
